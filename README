These are example files accompanying my D3 and Coffeescript video course published by O'Reilly Media: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/110000663.do

Contained are 3 examples:
1. Stock Market Visualization
2. Interactive Force-Directed Network Visualization
3. Chloropleth Map (visualizing earthquakes across the United States)

The easiest way to run an example is to navigate to the root directory of an example in terminal and then run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'. Then navigate to localhost:8000 in your browser. To stop the server, just press control-c in the terminal you used to start the server.
